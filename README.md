# Hiring

Hi! If you are reading this you might be interested in working with us.

We are Hash, an infrastructure for payments and financial services, and our mission is to enable anyone to build the best financial experience.

We are constantly seeking people that want to change the way the payment market is structured today. We are building a new infrastructure that allows the entrance of new payment players on a R$1.4tri market dominated by a few companies for the past 15 years. We do this by offering a platform where any company can be their own payment service.

To build this infrastructure, we need to build an amazing and scalable product. We need the best developers. "Move fast and break things" doesn't really work for the type of system that we build. We tend to reduce technical debt and prioritize quality over a fast release.

We are not attached to a specific set of programming languages or architecture, we have several challenges and we are free to choose the best way to attack each one of them, following state-of-the-art software development practices and choosing the best programming language and stack to solve what we need.

Today we are building:

* Horizontally scalable micro-services written mostly in Node.js or Clojure
* Data storage in MongoDB and Postgres
* Continuous Integration and Deployment into AWS, GCLOUD and Azure
* A highly modular front-end that integrates the design team in the development process

We are looking for people passionate for coding, with experience on building scalable products and exceptional technical background.

Technology is the most important part of our business, so we need people who wants to know more about our market, about how the payment ecosystem works and help us to change it. We want people that connects with our business and we want to build something that will change Brazil.

# Key Values

We've broken down some of our engineering team core values (thanks https://www.keyvalues.com/) to make our desired culture more transparent to everyone:

## High Quality Codebase

High availability is mandatory.

Money is critical, and we must deliver an awesome infrastructure that enables our clients to provide the best financial experience to their customers.

To meet this requirement, we invest in quality code by making it a priority and building it into our processes. We don't like getting bogged down by technical debt and anyone in the future should be able to understand the previous technical decisions taken to build a service, this greatly increases maintenance productivity and avoid repeating past mistakes.

This means we:

  - Periodically review our code organization and data structures.
  - Devote time to DevOps and refactoring projects. 
  - Document all our technical discussions and decisions on the problems we solve. 

## Open Communication

We believe transparency is the core of building long lasting trust relationships. Working with open and consistent people is one of our greatest values and we need this to expand to all the areas we can. We open source all of our SDKs and make sure our partners are aware of things when they come up, especially when it's bad news that may affect them. Open communication builds trust and without that we wouldn't be where we are.

We practice this by:

- Maintaining a healthy 1:1s schedule to keep the feedbacks flowing and opening the space to talk about any problem
- Encouraging slack messages to be on public channels by default
- Maintaining a visual board that reflects our current Github milestones/issues state to anyone in the company see what we are doing

## Flexible Work Arrangements

We hire mature and committed people, therefore we trust people to build their schedule to fit their needs. Here you are free to work at any given time in any given place, we believe this is a factor that helps people reach their peak performance.

We think that we shouldn't push the work onto people, so we don't organize "sprints" or any sort of "periodical synchronous team ceremony", what we do instead is to coordinate the work asynchronously so people can always pull a task to do any time they want, and we do our best to maintain development organic and organized

## Committed to personal growth

Like any relationship, our company has a two-way value stream with the people that work here. As a company we would like to see our products thrive, and as developers people want to be able to unleash their creativity and we know that sometimes this might not be 100% aligned with our current product in the short-run, but in the long-run we believe that giving people time to do whatever they want will result in innovation and a healthier life. We support that people use roughly 20% of their work time to research or build anything they want, be it related to Hash or not.

As for the company's growth, we dedicate time to understand if our processes are still fullfilling people's needs. We value context over blindly repeating processes, so we have to dedicate time to study the context continuously.
 
## Fosters Psychological Safety

If people aren't safe to express what they want then we've failed to embrace diversity. We understand that we are faulty humans and we have to deal with personal matters from time to time. Here at Hash we look out for each other much like friends would do, and we believe this is part of what enables a group to reach it's peak productivity.

## Engages with community

Good developers will always want to work with other good developers. We encourage anyone here to talk in tech events and we help covering costs to make this happen. We learned from open source and now we want to give back to the current and next generation of developers, so anything built here can (and should!) be open sourced.

We are not happy with the current technical level that most events in Brazil sets, so we plan on making our own tech events and maybe even conferences to be able to spread sparse knowledge about what we and other companies built. By "sparse knowledge" we mean real life problems and solutions for large scale software.

## Start-to-Finish Ownership

You are allowed to do what you think it's right for the product you are building. You are responsible for what you are doing, and you have the doors open to involve yourself in any area that permeates a product since this will bring you a wider vision of people that will be affected by your work.

We know that people have strength to do this, but we also know sometimes they have bad managers and this might be a huge barrier for motivation, so we not only encourage people to speak up to any problem, we make it everyone's duty to do so. If you donâ€™t like what you see you should raise the flag and talk about it to any person in the company.

## Product-driven

Our product is complex and we are on an ecosystem of legacy systems and huge players. We were not the first company on this market, we do not have all the features - yet - so we need to be the best. We are building it to the long run. We do not customize our solution to one person or team, instead we develop features that will attend those individual needs in a broad manner. We strive to design the best usability to make our awesome tech tangible to people.
